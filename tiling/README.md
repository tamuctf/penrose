# penrose-tiling

This crate is a port of Jason Healy's [Penrose Empires](http://logn.net/penrose/) thesis and Java implementation. Much
of this crate is a near-direct port of the algorithms present and abstractions in the Java implementation; algorithms,
implementation, and research was done by Jason and we urge you to go read [his thesis](http://logn.net/s/penrose/download/PenroseEmpiresThesis.pdf)
for further details.

and that the authors reached out to Jason for authorisation to re-license under GPLv3.
